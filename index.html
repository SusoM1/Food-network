            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Successful restaurants are, first and foremost, about the food. Your restaurant should have a core group
                of
                recipes that please your customers and can be prepared by the kitchen staff. You may also choose to
                offer
                changing specials that provide variety for both your staff and your customers. Ingredients should be
                affordable
                and purchased in quantities you can move quickly enough to maintain freshness, but not so quickly that
                you
                run
                out.</p>

                <p>Panch phoron (পাঁচ ফোড়ন pãch pho?on) is a whole spice blend used as a flavor enhancer to a
                    number of
                    dishes on Bangladesh. The name literally means “five spices”. Unlike most spice mixes, panch
                    phoron
                    is
                    always used whole and never ground. Traditionally, panch phoron is used with vegetables,

                <p>As the name implies, this classical Bengladeshi meat dish uses whole spices instead of pastes
                    and
                    powders. There are two steps to this and one may stop at the first step – which is cooking
